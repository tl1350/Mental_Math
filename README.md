# Mental_Math
Mental Math Program with voiceover and Excel summary of results.

I wrote this program to practice several tricks I picked up from Secrets of Mental Math by Arthur Benjamin and Michael Shermer.

This program allows the user to focus on training the below. The math problems are also read outloud to allow you to do mental math problems that are spoken.

1. Three digit addition and subtraction >> book trick - do the problem left to right
2. Two digit multiplications >> book trick - do the problem left to right
3. Two digit squares >> If we are interested in a^2 >> use (a+b)(a-b) = a^2 -b^2 >> a^2 = (a+b)(a-b) + b^2 . Find a b so that either (a+b) or (a-b) is a multiple of ten.
